# Security Policy
## Supported Version
* Only the rewritten Rust Version is supported! Earlier Go Versions of Cyrkensia are deprecated and there won't be any support.
* Custom modified builds or nightly builds are not supported! Only issues related to untouched code on a stable build are dealt with.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Vulnerabilities can be reported as usual via the Security Advisory, but also as a GitHub Issue. I don't expect any major CVEs.
