# Security Policy
## Supported Version
As of the major transition from v1.1.5 to v1.2.0, the Go versions are abandoned and thus not supported, since the codebase got rewritten in Rust.  
Only the latest stable/released version is supported! These versions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Stridsvagn69420/Cyrkensia/releases) and [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cyrkensia).  
Custom modified builds or nightly builds are not supported! Despite this, if the significant code is the same as in a custom *stable* build, the issue will be dealt with.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Since I don't expect any big vulnerability in the Cyrkensia code itself but rather it's dependencies, any issue can be reported in GitHub's issue tab. Pull Request (e.g. by Dependabot) will be accepted immediately when it's fixing a big security vulnerability in a dependency.
