# Security Policy
## Supported Version
- Only the rewritten Rust Version is supported! Earlier Go Versions of Cyrkensia are deprecated and there won't be any support.
- Custom modified builds or nightly builds are not supported! Only issues related to untouched code on a stable build are dealt with.
- Note that also only the latest stable release is supported. I think this is very obvious.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Vulnerabilities can be reported as usual via the Security Advisory, but also as a GitHub Issue. I don't expect any major CVEs. Though this policy might change in the future.
